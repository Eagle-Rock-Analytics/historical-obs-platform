Flag_value,QAQC_function,Flag_meaning
1,spurious_buoy_check,Suspect observation (i.e. buoy reports wind during day with known proximity issue)
2,spurious_buoy_check,Out of range for station official data temporal record (i.e. buoy reports data past disestablishment date)
3,qaqc_elev_infill,Elevation infilled from DEM (USGS 3DEP)
4,qaqc_elev_infill,Elevation infilled from station
5,qaqc_elev_infill,Elevation manually infilled for buoy out-of-range of DEM (check if not buoy)
6,qaqc_sensor_height_t,Thermometer height missing
7,qaqc_sensor_height_t,Thermometer height not 2 meters
8,qaqc_sensor_height_w,Anemometer height missing
9,qaqc_sensor_height_w,Anemometer height not 10 meters
10,qaqc_precip_logic_nonegvals,Precipitation value reported below 0 (negative value)
11,qaqc_world_record,Value outside of world record range
12,qaqc_crossvar_logic_tdps_to_tas,Cross-variable logic check failure: dewpoint temperature exceeds air temperature
13,qaqc_crossvar_logic_calm_wind_dir,Cross-variable logic check failure: wind direction is not zero when wind speed is zero
14,qaqc_crossvar_logic_calm_wind_dir,Cross-variable logic check failure: wind direction manually reset to 360 to represent true northerly winds
15,qaqc_precip_logic_accum_amounts,Cross-variable logic check failure: accumulated precipitation value in shorter window is larger than in longer window (e.g. pr_5min > pr_1h)
16,qaqc_precip_logic_accum_amounts,Cross-variable logic check failure: accumulated precipitation value in longer window is smaller than in shorter window (e.g. pr_24h < pr_1h)
17,qaqc_precip_logic_accum_amounts,Cross-variable logic check failure: accumulated precipitation in a 24h period is too low compared to accumulated precipitation since local midnight
18,qaqc_unusual_gaps,Warning: Whole station has too few monthly observations to proceed through the monthly distribution gap check. Observations were not assessed for quality.
19,qaqc_unusual_gaps,Warning: Variable has too few monthly observations to proceed through the monthly distribution gap check. Observations were not assessed for quality.
20,qaqc_unusual_gaps,Part 1: Monthly median value exceeds set threshold limits around monthly interquartile range for the monthly climatological median value
21,qaqc_unusual_gaps,Part 2: Unusual gap in monthly distribution detected beyond PDF distribution
22,qaqc_unusual_large_jumps,Unusual jump (spike) in variable
