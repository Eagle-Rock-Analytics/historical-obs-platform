10,qaqc_precip_logic_nonegvals,Precipitation value reported below 0 (negative value)
11,qaqc_world_record,Value outside of world record range
12,qaqc_crossvar_logic_tdps_to_tas_supersat,Cross-variable logic check failure: dewpoint temperature exceeds air temperature
13,qaqc_crossvar_logic_tdps_to_tas_wetbulb,Cross-variable logic check failure: extended streak of a zero dewpoint depression (indicative of instrument failure)
14,qaqc_crossvar_logic_calm_wind_dir,Cross-variable logic check failure: wind direction is not zero when wind speed is zero
15,qaqc_crossvar_logic_calm_wind_dir,Cross-variable logic check failure: wind direction manually reset to 360 to represent true northerly winds
16,qaqc_precip_logic_accum_amounts,Cross-variable logic check failure: accumulated precipitation value in shorter window is larger than in longer window (e.g. pr_5min > pr_1h)
17,qaqc_precip_logic_accum_amounts,Cross-variable logic check failure: accumulated precipitation value in longer window is smaller than in shorter window (e.g. pr_24h < pr_1h)
18,qaqc_precip_logic_accum_amounts,Cross-variable logic check failure: accumulated precipitation in a 24h period is too low compared to accumulated precipitation since local midnight    
19,qaqc_unusual_gaps,Warning: Whole station has too few monthly observations to proceed through the monthly distribution gap check. Observations were not assessed for quality.
20,qaqc_unusual_gaps,Warning: Variable has too few monthly observations to proceed through the monthly distribution gap check. Observations were not assessed for quality.
21,qaqc_unusual_gaps,Part 1: Monthly median value exceeds set threshold limits around monthly interquartile range for the monthly climatological median value
22,qaqc_unusual_gaps,Part 2: Unusual gap in monthly distribution detected beyond PDF distribution
23,qaqc_unusual_large_jumps,Unusual jump (spike) in variable
24,qaqc_frequent_vals,Value flagged as unusually frequent in occurrence at the annual scale after assessing the entire observation record. Temperature and dew point temperature are synergistically flagged
25,qaqc_frequent_vals,Value flagged as unusually frequent in occurrence at the seasonal scale after assessing the entire observation record. Temperature and dew point temperature are synergistically flagged
26,qaqc_climatological_outlier,Value flagged as a climatological outlier for specific month and hour
27,qaqc_unusual_repeated_streaks,Same hour observation replication over a number of days or number of observations
28,qaqc_unusual_repeated_streaks,Straight one after another replications over a number of observartions
29,qaqc_unusual_repeated_streaks,Whole day replication for a streak of days
30,VALLEYWATER_clean,Infilled with NaN resulting from off-set times in the raw data due to sensor malfunction. Maintains consistent timesteps throughout timeseries
31,qaqc_frequent_precip,Value flagged as unusually frequent in occurrence from daily precipitation above moderate rain total
32,qaqc_climatological_outlier_precip,Value flagged as a climatological outlier in daily precipitation check
33,qaqc_unusual_gaps_precip,Value flagged as an unusual gap in values in the daily precipitation check
34,qaqc_deaccumulate_precip,Value flagged has a period of oscillating values (probably sensor malfunction producing ringing-like data) in the accumulated precipitation (that would result on incorrect/false de-accumulated values that look correct): cannot determine which value (higher or lower) is the real one (it has been also converted to nan in the deaccumulated series)
35,qaqc_deaccumulate_precip,Original precipitation data; deaccumulation process has been applied
36,qaqc_elev_internal_range_consistency,Range of elevation values reported or in-filled is larger than 50 m; elevation values greater than absolute elevation median value +/-50m are flagged
37,VALLEYWATER_qaqc_custom,Lone peak identified in precipitation (single observation >= 5.08mm with no other precip obs in +/- 6hr window); VALLEYWATER network flag only
38,merge_derive_missing,At least one input variable to derived variable has a flag placed. Input variable and derived variable are synergistically flagged
