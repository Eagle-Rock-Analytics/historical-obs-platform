asos_lookup.py

A user can pass either the ASOS airport code or the “city” and the script/function identifes and returns the name of the HDP station.
E.g., “I need to find KSAC weather station” or “I need to find the Sacramento Executive Airport weather station”

Script then identifies KSAC as “ASOSAWOS_XXXXXXXX”

Reasoning: Looking up the specific HDP stations from the attached spreadsheet was not straightforward or easy; users may very likely 
come to HDP knowing specifically which station they are looking for, and it’s not obvious which station is which.
